# rlistings 0.1.1.9009
 * `matrix_form(lsting, TRUE)` is no longer an error, now silently has the same behavior as

## rlistings 0.1.1
 * add title, subtitle, and (main and prov) footer support
 * now depends on dplyr instead of magrittr to hopefully avoid var_labels droppage issues

 * Add Get Started vignette and update README.
 * Add regression tests.
