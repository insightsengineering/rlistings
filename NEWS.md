# rlistings 0.1.1.9005
 * Added `test-paginate_listing.R` and improved file organization and test 
   standards.
 * Polished `DESCRIPTION` file.
 * Add Get Started vignette.
 * Update README.

## rlistings 0.1.1
 * Add title, subtitle, and (main and prov) footer support.
 * Now depends on dplyr instead of magrittr to hopefully avoid `var_labels` droppage issues.
 * `paginate_listing` now supports pagination in both directions.

## rlistings 0.1.0
 * Initial experimental rlistings API. Everything subject to change.
