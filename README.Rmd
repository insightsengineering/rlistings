## Listings with R

[![cheatsheet](https://img.shields.io/badge/cheatsheet-rlistings-blue)](https://insightsengineering.github.io/rlistings/inst/cheatsheet/rlistings_cheatsheet_03-24.pdf)

The `rlistings` R package is a package that was designed to create and
display listings with R. The focus of this package is to provide
functionality for value formatting and ASCII rendering infrastructure
for tables and listings. Many of the functions contained in `rlistings`
depend on the
[`formatters`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/formatters/)
package, which provides a framework for ASCII rendering and is available
on CRAN.

`rlistings` development is driven by the need to create regulatory ready
listings for health authority review. Some of the key requirements for
this undertaking are listed below:

-   flexible formatting (pagesize, column widths, alignment, labels,
    etc.)
-   multiple output formats (csv, out, txt)
-   repeated key columns
-   flexible pagination in both horizontal and vertical directions
-   titles and footnotes

`rlistings` currently covers some of these requirements, and remains
under active development.

## Installation

`rlistings` is available on CRAN and you can install the latest released
version with:

``` r
install.packages("rlistings")
```

or you can install the latest development version directly from GitHub
with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("insightsengineering/formatters")
remotes::install_github("insightsengineering/rlistings")
```
Note you might need to set your `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable in
order to be able to install from GitHub.

Packaged releases (both those on CRAN and those between official CRAN
releases) can be found in the [releases
list](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rlistings/releases).

## Usage

The following example shows a simple listing and its printed output.

```{r}
library(rlistings)

# Reducing the data
mtcars_ex <- mtcars %>% dplyr::mutate("car" = rownames(mtcars))

as_listing(mtcars_ex,
  key_cols = c("gear", "carb"),
  disp_cols = c("gear", "carb", "qsec", "car")
) %>% head()
```

## Acknowledgment

This package is a result of a joint effort by many developers and
stakeholders. We would like to thank everyone who contributed so far!
