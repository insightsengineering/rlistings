\arguments{
\item{x}{listing_df. The listing.}

\item{...}{dots. Unused}

\item{tt}{ANY. Object representing the table-like object to be summarized.}

\item{colwidths}{numeric. Print  widths of  columns, if  manually
set/previously known.}

\item{visible_only}{logical(1). Should only visible aspects of the table structure be reflected in this summary. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. May not be supported by all methods.}

\item{rownum}{numeric(1). Internal detail do not set manually.}

\item{indent}{integer(1). Internal detail do not set manually.}

\item{path}{character.  Path  to  the (sub)table  represented  by
    \code{tt}. Defaults to \code{character()}

 @details When  \code{visible_only} is  \code{TRUE} (the  default),
    methods should  return a  data.frame with  exactly one  row per
    visible  row in  the table-like  object.  This  is useful  when
    reasoning about  how a table  will print, but does  not reflect
    the full pathing space of the structure (though the paths which
    are given will all work as is).

If  supported,  when  \code{visible_only}  is  \code{FALSE},  every
structural element of the table (in row-space) will be reflected in
the  returned data.frame,  meaning the  full pathing-space  will be
represented but some rows in  the layout summary will not represent
printed rows in the table as it is displayed.

Most arguments beyond \code{tt} and \code{visible_only} are present so that
`make_row_df` methods can call `make_row_df` recursively and retain information,
and should not be set during a top-level call}

\item{incontent}{logical(1). Internal detail do not set manually.}

\item{repr_ext}{integer(1). Internal detail do not set manually.}

\item{repr_inds}{integer. Internal detail do not set manually.}

\item{sibpos}{integer(1). Internal detail do not set manually.}

\item{nsibs}{integer(1). Internal detail do not set manually.}

\item{i}{
    indices specifying elements to extract or replace.  Indices are
    \code{numeric} or \code{character} vectors or empty (missing) or
    \code{NULL}.  Numeric values are coerced to integer as by
    \code{\link[base]{as.integer}} (and hence truncated towards zero).
    Character vectors will be matched to the \code{\link[base]{names}} of the
    object (or for matrices/arrays, the \code{\link[base]{dimnames}}):
    see \sQuote{Character indices} below for further details.

    For \code{[}-indexing only: \code{i}, \code{j}, \code{\dots} can be
    logical vectors, indicating elements/slices to select.  Such vectors
    are recycled if necessary to match the corresponding extent.
    \code{i}, \code{j}, \code{\dots} can also be negative integers,
    indicating elements/slices to leave out of the selection.

    When indexing arrays by \code{[} a single argument \code{i} can be a
    matrix with as many columns as there are dimensions of \code{x}; the
    result is then a vector with elements corresponding to the sets of
    indices in each row of \code{i}.

    An index value of \code{NULL} is treated as if it were \code{integer(0)}.
  }

\item{j}{
    indices specifying elements to extract or replace.  Indices are
    \code{numeric} or \code{character} vectors or empty (missing) or
    \code{NULL}.  Numeric values are coerced to integer as by
    \code{\link[base]{as.integer}} (and hence truncated towards zero).

  }

\item{drop}{For matrices and arrays.  If \code{TRUE} the result is
    coerced to the lowest possible dimension (see the examples).  This
    only works for extracting elements, not for the replacement.  See
    \code{\link[base]{drop}} for further details.
  }

\item{obj}{The object.}

\item{lsting}{listing_df. The listing to paginate.}

\item{lpp}{numeric(1). Number of row lines (not counting titles and
footers) to have per page.}

\item{min_siblings}{numeric. Minimum sibling rows which must appear on either side of pagination row for a
mid-subtable split to be valid. Defaults to 2.}

\item{nosplitin}{character. List of names of sub-tables where page-breaks are not allowed, regardless of other
considerations. Defaults to none.}

\item{verbose}{logical(1). Should additional informative messages about the search for
pagination breaks be shown. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
